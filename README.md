## About

This project is an application to create groups, being able to add people divided into teams, with the main objective of **organizing teams** to play with your friends, family or co-workers, for example. With this application it is possible to **create and remove groups**, as well as **add and remove players** from the team. 

The project was developed using these technologies:
- TypeScript
- React Native
- Expo Managed Workflow
- Styled Components
- React Navigation
- Async Storage (used to local storage of groups and players)

Also, this project was developed in the React Native training of the [**Rocketseat**](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) **Ignite** course. The main purpose of this app was to practice styling, navigation and local storage, as well as some React Hooks and techniques, and good coding practices.
